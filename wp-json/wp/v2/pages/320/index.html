The philosophy of AI is an emerging field. Right now, AI is importantly concerned with Large Language Models (LLMs). It is also concerned with the relation between natural and artificial intelligence. Accordingly, one may expect that at least some of the values that pertain to AI are linguistic and epistemic. For example, relevant norms might be concerned with the values of truth, understanding, and accuracy. And yet, debates about \u201cethical AI\u201d are predominantly about \u201cfairness,\u201d typically understood as the elimination of bias. One guiding question for our seminar is whether and how AI can integrate a range of human values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the seminar are workshop sessions associated with the <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost:10023\/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"8\">ValuesLab<\/a>. Invited guest speakers come from a wide range of fields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The semester starts with an introduction to the philosophy of AI. This includes the widely debated alignment problem, the question of how AIs can be aligned with human values (Week 1). To appreciate the difficulty of the problem, we look at approaches in normative ethics (Weeks 2 and 3); given the differences between them, it is by no means clear with which values AI should be aligned. Next we turn to fairness and accuracy in AIs (Weeks 4 and 5). We ask whether AIs have beliefs and intentions, engage in reasoning, lie and can be held responsible (Weeks 6-8). We study new work on \u201cexplainable AI,\u201d on whether and how AI-outputs can be understood (Weeks 9-10). We examine questions about language and linguistic norms as they apply to AIs (Weeks 11-13) and end with a concluding discussion (Week 14).<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">COMS W2702 AI in Context<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Team-taught, interdisciplinary class, Fall 2024<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the course description:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>This team-taught, interdisciplinary class covers the history of AI, the development from Neural Networks (NNs) to Large Language Models (LLMs), philosophy of AI, as well as the role of AI in music and writing. Four sessions are devoted to foundational philosophical questions that bear on AI. Session 1: Can we ascribe beliefs and intentions to AI? Can LLMs speak? Can they lie? Session 2: Can AI be aligned with human values? What is explainable AI (XAI)? Session 3: What makes an AI \u201cfair\u201d? How does fairness relate to accuracy and other values? Session 4: How should LLMs deal with generics? What about social generics and bias?<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[Contributors to syllabus development: Qian Cao, Jens Haas, Anthony Dyson Hejduk, Wooseok Kim, Tahlia Pajaczkowska-Russell, Katja Maria Vogt] v2024.06.04 PHIL GR9180 Approaches to Applied Ethics: Philosophy of AI Seminar, Fall 2024 From the course description: This seminar aims to contribute to dialogue between philosophers and AI developers, and to a shared vocabulary.
